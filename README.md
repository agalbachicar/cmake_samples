# cmake_samples

## Description

This repository contains three sample basic projects of C++ code to create:

* A sample app
* A sample shared library
* A sample static library

All three projects have the same code and instructions for building. Just cmake, make and gcc is needed. The important thing is the CMakeLists.txt of each project to create the Makefiles.
